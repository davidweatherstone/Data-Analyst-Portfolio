## Overview
Welcome to my Data Portfolio. As a Data Analyst, I am **passionate** about using my analytical skills and technical knowledge to accelerate and improve decision-making. My studies in **Excel**, **SQL**, **Python** and **Power BI**, along with my **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate**, have prepared me to excel in data analysis and reporting.

You can find my CV <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/142d5TQWKCrVZc82qEh1DiEH4BZE-JGn3/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">here</a>. I also maintain a [personal blog](https://davidweatherstone.onrender.com/) where posts relate to the topics I am studying.


## Skills
üìä **Microsoft Excel**: v/xlookups, pivot tables, conditional formatting, data validation, charts and graphs.

üíæ **SQL**: querying, joins, aggregations, data normalisation, views, stored procedures, common table expressions.

üîÆ **Power BI**: DAX, data modelling, creating and formatting visualisations, data exploration and discovery.

üêç **Python**: Passionate about Python's versatility, with a particular focus on DataFrame libraries (like Pandas), plotting libraries (such as Matplotlib and Seaborn), and web frameworks (including Flask and FastHTML).

## Projects

### Python
* **Market Intelligence reporting**, leverages HTML and CSS to design a A4 template for PDF reports. Utilizing Flask for server-side processing and Jinja2 for templating, I dynamically integrate a dictionary of Matplotlib figures and strings into the HTML file. This setup enables the seamless generation of paginated reports.

* **UK Vehicle Accident data exploration**, I utilized the Pandas library to clean the dataset and optimize data types. Following this I continued using Pandas to explore the data and combined that with the Seaborn library to visualize queries created to understand the data further.

* **Move My Pallets** is a logistics website designed to streamline the process of pallet movement. Powered by Python (Flask, Jinja2), SQL, and HTML/CSS (Bootstrap), the platform connects customers needing pallets moved with suppliers bidding for their transportation. [[Code]](https://github.com/davidweatherstone/move_my_pallets/)
  
### SQL
* **Data cleaning**, Vehicle licensing statistics: A project to clean and analyse data from GOV.UK. [[Documentation]](Projects/SQL%20Cleaning%20-%20Vehicle%20licensing%20statistics/) [[Code]](Projects/SQL%20Cleaning%20-%20Vehicle%20licensing%20statistics/README.md)

* **Data exploration**, Weatherline Lake district: Analysis of historical weather patterns in the Lake District. [[Documentation]](Projects/SQL%20Data%20exploration%20-%20Weatherline/) [[Code]](Projects/SQL%20Data%20exploration%20-%20Weatherline/README.md)

### Power BI
* **Human Resources dashboard**, this is a Power BI dashboard example I created for a fictional company's Human Resources department. The dashboard tracks important metrics such as employee demographics and staff turnover. [[Documentation]](Projects/Power%20BI%20-%20Human%20Resources%20dashboard/README.md) [[NovyPro dashboard link]](https://www.novypro.com/project/pimhrdashboard)

* **Procurement dashboard**, I created a dashboard for a fictitious company that offers a detailed analysis of spend and supplier data. The dashboard allows for filtering by department, line of business, and budget, providing valuable insights into the company's financial performance and supplier relationships.
